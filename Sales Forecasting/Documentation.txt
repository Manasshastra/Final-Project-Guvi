Title: Predictive Modeling for Sales Forecasting

Introduction:

In this project, we aim to develop predictive models to forecast sales for a retail company based on historical data. The dataset comprises various features such as sales, customer demographics, promotional events, and macroeconomic indicators. The goal is to build accurate models that can predict future sales, enabling the company to optimize inventory management and resource allocation.

Methodology:

1. Data Preparation

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

4. Model Selection

5. Model Training and Evaluation


Results

The table below summarizes the performance of each model:

| Model              | MAE       | MSE       | RMSE      | R2 Score  |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Linear Regression  | 0.024     | 0.002     | 0.046     | 0.910     |
| Random Forest      | 0.018     | 0.001     | 0.037     | 0.950     |
| KNN                | 0.020     | 0.002     | 0.044     | 0.964     |
| XGBoost            | 0.017     | 0.001     | 0.036     | 0.974     |
| Deep Neural Network| 0.022     | 0.002     | 0.042     | 0.923     |


Conclusion

In conclusion, the predictive models established in this study work well in anticipating sales for the retail organization. The corporation may use machine learning approaches to make data-driven choices about inventory management, resource allocation, and overall business strategy. Moving forward, regular monitoring and refining of the models will be required to respond to changing market dynamics and remain competitive.
